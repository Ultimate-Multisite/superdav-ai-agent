/**
 * Client-side abilities entry point.
 *
 * Registers the gratis-ai-agent-js category and all client-side abilities
 * into the WP 7.0 `core/abilities` store. Import this module at the top of
 * each plugin entry point so registration happens before the chat UI mounts.
 *
 * This module is idempotent — safe to import multiple times.
 *
 * Order matters here: the category MUST be registered (and its async
 * `registerAbilityCategory` Promise MUST resolve) before any ability that
 * lives in it. Previously navigation.js and editor.js self-registered at
 * module-eval time and the registry helpers called the WP 7.0 API
 * synchronously without awaiting the returned Promises — leaving abilities
 * trying to register into a not-yet-resolved category and the
 * `@wordpress/abilities` library throwing
 * "Ability references non-existent category" errors. (Fix landed in t166.)
 *
 * Cross-bundle deduplication (GH#990):
 * Each webpack entry-point bundle has its own module scope and therefore its
 * own `registrationPromise`. When multiple bundles (e.g. floating-widget.js
 * and screen-meta.js) are enqueued on the same admin page, each bundle
 * previously ran the full registration pipeline independently. This caused
 * `wp.abilities.registerAbilityCategory()` to be called once per bundle,
 * which in WP 7.0-RC2 triggers a REST fetch to `/wp-json/wp-abilities/v1/abilities`
 * for each call — resulting in duplicate simultaneous requests, one of which
 * was aborted and logged a console error.
 *
 * The fix: `ensureRegistered()` checks a page-level window global
 * (`window.__gratisAiAgentAbilitiesRegistering`) before creating a new
 * Promise. If another bundle on the same page has already started or
 * completed the pipeline, the second bundle awaits the same Promise instead
 * of launching a duplicate registration.

 * bundle on the same page has already started or completed registration,
 * this call returns the existing Promise without re-running the pipeline.
 *
 * If the abilities API was not available when the attempt ran (e.g. the

 * registerCategory() silently no-ops and the promise resolves without
 * registering anything. In that case both the module-level promise and the
