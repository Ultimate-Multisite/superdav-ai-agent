/**
 * Client-side abilities registry for gratis-ai-agent-js namespace.
 *
 * Thin wrapper around @wordpress/abilities (exposed by core 7.0 as the
 * `wp.abilities` global, populated when the script module loads) that:
 *
 *   - Registers the gratis-ai-agent-js category (idempotent, async).
 *   - Provides registerClientAbility() to register abilities with the
 *     correct shape required by the WP 7.0 API (single options object,
 *     with `name` as a property).
 *   - Provides snapshotDescriptors() to capture current descriptors for
 *     posting to the server in the /chat request body
 *     (used by sessionsSlice sendMessage thunk).
 *
 * Bug history (#806 → #815 → #821 → t166):
 *   - #815 (in #815's PR) shipped this file with three API misuses that
 *     prevented any ability from registering at runtime:
 *       a) registerAbilityCategory() was called without a `description`
 *          field, which is required per the WP 7.0 dev note. Fix: add it.
 *       b) registerAbility() was called with two positional arguments
 *          (def.name, options) instead of the documented single options
 *          object containing `name`. The library read `.name` off the
 *          options bag, found undefined, and threw "Ability name is
 *          required". Fix: pass a single object.
 *       c) Both registerAbilityCategory() and registerAbility() in the
 *          WP 7.0 API are ASYNC and return Promises. The category Promise
 *          had not yet resolved when the abilities tried to register
 *          synchronously, so the abilities looked up a not-yet-existent
 *          category and threw "Ability references non-existent category".
 *          Fix: await every registration call.
 *
 *   - #821 (t165) wired the entry-point imports so this file actually
 *     ran, which surfaced the throws above as visible console errors
 *     during a browser smoke test.
 *
 *   - This task (t166) fixes all three API misuses and makes the
 *     registration pipeline properly async-aware.

/**
 * Snapshot the current gratis-ai-agent-js/* ability descriptors as plain objects.
 *
 * Returns an array of descriptor objects suitable for posting to the server
 * as `client_abilities` in the /chat request body. The server validates each
 * name against JsAbilityCatalog::get_descriptors() and drops unknown names.
 *
 * Reads via `wp.abilities.getAbilities()` (the script-module API) rather
 * than via `wp.data.select('core/abilities').getAbilities()`.
 *
 * Root cause (t169 / GH#825, investigated 2026-04-08):
 * The WP 7.0 dev note claims `@wordpress/core-abilities` is enqueued by
 * core on all admin pages, but in WP 7.0-RC2 the module is only
 * *registered* — never added to the script-module queue. Without an
 * explicit `wp_enqueue_script_module('@wordpress/core-abilities')` call,
 * the REST fetch that populates the `core/abilities` wp.data store never
 * runs, so `wp.data.select('core/abilities').getAbilities()` returns 0
 * items. Our PHP enqueue (FloatingWidget, ScreenMetaPanel, UnifiedAdminMenu)
 * now explicitly enqueues `@wordpress/core-abilities` to fix this.
 *
 * The `wp.abilities.getAbilities()` call below reads from the same Redux
 * store via `select(store).getAbilities()` — it is synchronous and returns
 * an array, not a Promise. The `await` is kept for forward-compatibility
 * in case the API becomes async in a future WP version.
 *
 * TODO(t169): Once WP 7.0 final ships and the upstream enqueue gap is
 * confirmed fixed (or a core bug is filed), verify whether the explicit
 * `@wordpress/core-abilities` enqueue in our PHP files can be removed.
 * If core reliably enqueues it, the workaround becomes redundant.
 *
 * Callers should `await ensureRegistered()` from index.js before calling
 * this so the registration Promises are guaranteed to have resolved.
 *
 * @return {Promise<Array<{name: string, label: string, description: string, input_schema: Object, output_schema: Object, annotations: Object}>>} Promise of client ability descriptors.
