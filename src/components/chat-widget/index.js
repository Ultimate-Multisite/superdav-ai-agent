/**
 * Floating chat widget top-level — renders either the launcher (FAB)
 * when closed, or the redesigned widget panel when open. State for
 * open/minimized comes from the shared store so every surface
 * (keyboard shortcut, close button, legacy code paths) stays in sync.
 *
 * Bundle strategy: WidgetPanel (and every component it imports —
 * ChangesDrawer, WidgetInput, ModelPicker, AgentPicker,
 * WidgetMessageList, ToolConfirmationDialog, SlashCommandMenu, …) lives
 * in a separate async chunk.  The browser downloads that chunk only the
 * first time the user opens the widget.
 *
 * webpackPrefetch causes the browser to fetch the chunk in the background
 * during idle time after the main page loads, so when the user clicks the
 * FAB the chunk is already cached — no visible delay on first open.
