 * DI container bootstrap performed by {@see xwp_load_app()}. For that reason
 * the activation / deactivation wiring cannot be expressed as `#[Handler]`
 * classes inside the DI graph — it has to be a plain static entry-point that
 * the plugin bootstrap file registers directly.
 *
 * This class consolidates the handful of static calls that used to live in
 * `sd-ai-agent.php` so the root file stays thin and responsibilities are
 * grouped by lifecycle stage.
