A native AI agent for WordPress. Fix, publish, optimise, and run your site from WordPress admin — with the AI provider you choose.

== Description ==

SD AI Agent is a native AI agent for the WordPress site you already run. Ask it to improve a page, draft content, review SEO opportunities, prepare media, answer questions with site context, or run routine admin work from inside WordPress using natural language.

Try it at [sdaiagent.com](https://sdaiagent.com), an AI site builder demo site.

You stay in control: choose the included SD AI-managed service or your own compatible WordPress AI provider, decide which tools the agent can use, and require confirmation before consequential actions run.

= What it helps you do =

* **Improve content faster** — review pages and posts, find SEO opportunities, draft updates, organise categories and tags, and prepare changes for your approval.
* **Use your site context** — save preferences and site facts as memory, then search posts, pages, documents, and other indexed knowledge during a conversation.
* **Publish with fewer handoffs** — work with copy, media, products, comments, settings, and supported plugin tools without jumping between admin screens.
* **Automate routine work** — schedule prompts or respond to WordPress and WooCommerce events for reports, moderation, reminders, follow-up, and maintenance checks.
* **Review work before it changes your site** — use read-only or scoped tool profiles, disable tools you do not want available, and approve sensitive actions before they run.
* **Understand usage** — review conversation history, tool activity, exports, token usage, and estimated provider costs.

= Work where you already work =

Open **AI Agent > Chat** for longer jobs with folders, search, history, and exports. Use the compact admin widget when you want quick help while editing another WordPress screen.

= Bring context to every conversation =

SD AI Agent can remember site preferences, reuse team instructions, and search a local knowledge base built from your WordPress content and uploaded documents. That context helps the assistant produce answers and drafts that fit your site instead of starting from a blank prompt each time.

= Automate without giving up control =

Create reusable skills, custom HTTP tools, WordPress action tools, scheduled tasks, and event-driven workflows. Start with focused jobs such as a daily site-health report, a weekly content review, a new-post summary, a WooCommerce order follow-up, or a moderation check. Logs and confirmations keep the work reviewable.

= Before you start =

You need WordPress 7.0 or later and PHP 8.2 or later. Use the included SD AI managed service, or install a compatible WordPress AI provider connector. Third-party providers may charge for model usage; review their pricing and privacy terms before sending content or attachments.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate SD AI Agent from the WordPress Plugins screen.
2. Go to **Settings > Connectors**. Connect the included SD AI managed service, or configure a compatible connector for your preferred AI provider.
3. Visit **AI Agent > Settings** to choose your default provider and model.
4. Open **AI Agent > Abilities** to review the available tools and access controls.
5. Open **AI Agent > Chat** and start with a focused task, such as improving a draft or finding information from your site.

= Requirements =

* WordPress 7.0 or higher
* PHP 8.2 or higher
* The included SD AI managed service, or an AI provider connector plugin registered through the WordPress Connectors API
* Provider credentials when required by your selected service

== External Services ==

This plugin contacts outside services only when they are needed for a feature you use, except that the included SD AI managed service registers the site installation during activation. Other services are contacted when you configure the relevant key, URL, or feature; ask the agent to run an action that uses that service; or enable scheduled maintenance such as skill-manifest updates.

= SD AI managed service =

The included SD AI provider can register the site and provide AI responses when selected. Activation registration sends a durable installation ID, site URL, plugin version, and WordPress version. AI requests send the conversation messages, system prompt, attached files if any, and tool definitions needed to generate the reply.

= AI providers (chat completions) =

These are contacted only when configured in **Settings > Connectors** and selected for a response. Requests send the conversation messages, system prompt, attached files if any, and tool definitions to the chosen provider.

* **OpenAI** (api.openai.com) — Provides AI chat completions for OpenAI models. Terms: https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/ Privacy: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/

* **Google AI / Gemini** (generativelanguage.googleapis.com) — Provides AI chat completions for Gemini models. Terms: https://policies.google.com/terms Privacy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

**Other compatible providers.** Install [Ultimate AI Connector - Compatible Endpoints](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-ai-connector-compatible-endpoints/) to connect local models or other compatible provider endpoints. SD AI Agent uses the endpoint and data handling configured in that connector. Some endpoints may route requests through regional or cloud services such as Google Vertex AI (`*.aiplatform.googleapis.com`). Review the endpoint provider's terms and privacy policy.

= Internet search providers =

Internet search runs only when you or the agent explicitly request it. The first configured provider is used. Only the search topic comes from your query; requests may also include a configured Tavily or Brave API key, provider-specific request fields, DuckDuckGo API parameters, and a custom User-Agent.

* **Tavily Search API** (api.tavily.com) — Web search results when a Tavily key is configured. Terms: https://tavily.com/terms Privacy: https://tavily.com/privacy

= Plugin and skill maintenance =

* **GitHub** (github.com, api.github.com, raw.githubusercontent.com) — Provides optional public plugin ZIPs, public skill files, and WP-CLI download instructions. Contacted only when an administrator runs the skills sync command or installs a GitHub-hosted recommendation. Sends the requested public path plus normal HTTP metadata, not site content, conversation history, API keys, or settings. Terms: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service Privacy: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement

* **WordPress.org Plugin Directory** (api.wordpress.org and downloads.wordpress.org) — Provides plugin search, metadata, and ZIP downloads when you request a WordPress.org plugin. Sends the search keyword or slug, result count, and normal HTTP metadata. Terms / directory guidelines: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/ Privacy: https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/

* **Admin-supplied skill manifest URLs** — If you configure `skill_manifest_url`, the plugin can fetch that HTTPS JSON manifest for manual checks, lookups, or enabled auto-updates. The request sends the manifest path, JSON/cache headers, and normal HTTP metadata. Terms and privacy depend on the host you configure.

= Stock-image services =

Stock-image services run only when requested. They receive the search keyword and requested image dimensions, not site content or conversation history.

* **Openverse** (api.openverse.org) — Openly licensed image search hosted by the WordPress Foundation. No API key required. Terms: https://docs.openverse.org/terms_of_service.html Privacy: https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/

Sends the service-account token request plus the property ID, date range, and metrics requested. Google APIs Terms: https://developers.google.com/terms Privacy: https://policies.google.com/privacy Google Analytics terms: https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/

* **Google Search Console API** (searchconsole.googleapis.com and oauth2.googleapis.com) — Reads your Search Console query and page performance when credentials are configured and you request a report. Sends the token request or stored OAuth token plus the property URL, date range, dimensions, filters, and row limit. Google APIs Terms: https://developers.google.com/terms Privacy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

= User-configured and user-requested external URLs =

* **Custom HTTP tools and webhooks** — Administrators can create tools that call configured external URLs, including disabled examples for weather-style APIs and Zapier (`hooks.zapier.com`). Nothing is contacted unless the tool is enabled and run. Requests send the configured URL, method, headers, substituted inputs, and body. Terms and privacy depend on the configured service. Zapier Terms: https://zapier.com/tos Zapier Privacy: https://zapier.com/privacy

* **User-requested URL fetch, site scrape, and media import URLs** — URL metadata, SEO audit, scrape, upload-from-URL, and generated-image import tools contact only the URL you provide or approve. The target may receive the requested path, query string, normal HTTP metadata, and a WordPress user-agent; media import tools download the remote file into WordPress. Review the target site's terms and privacy policy before running the tool.

= Notifications (optional) =

* **Discord** (discord.com) — Optional automation-result webhooks. Sends the configured automation summary to the webhook URL only after you add one. Terms: https://discord.com/terms Privacy: https://discord.com/privacy

* **SD AI Agent feedback service** (ultimateagentwp.ai) — Optional user-submitted feedback and issue reports. Nothing is sent automatically; reports are sent only after you use thumbs-down or `/report-issue` and accept the consent preview. The payload is the sanitized conversation excerpt and metadata shown in the modal. Terms: https://ultimateagentwp.ai/terms/ Privacy: https://ultimateagentwp.ai/privacy/

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which AI providers are supported? =

The included SD AI-managed provider is supported. For local models or other compatible provider endpoints, install [Ultimate AI Connector - Compatible Endpoints](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-ai-connector-compatible-endpoints/) and configure the endpoint in **Settings > Connectors**. Available providers and models depend on the endpoint you configure.

= How much does it cost to use? =

The plugin is free and open source. The managed SD AI service uses account credits, while third-party providers apply their own pricing and terms. To use a local model or another compatible provider, connect its endpoint with [Ultimate AI Connector - Compatible Endpoints](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-ai-connector-compatible-endpoints/). The **Usage** tab records token usage and estimated provider costs when pricing data is available.

= Is my data sent to a third party? =

Content submitted for generation is sent to the service you select. SD AI requests are routed through the managed SD AI service; connector-based requests use the endpoint and data handling defined by that connector. Conversation history, memories, and knowledge are stored locally in your WordPress database.

= Can I use a local AI model? =

Yes. Install [Ultimate AI Connector - Compatible Endpoints](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-ai-connector-compatible-endpoints/), add your local model server or other compatible provider endpoint in **Settings > Connectors**, and then select its registered model in SD AI Agent. Availability, hardware requirements, and any hosting costs depend on the endpoint and inference service you choose.

= What can the agent actually do? =

The agent can use any tool (ability) registered on your WordPress site. Out of the box this includes managing posts, pages, comments, media, site options, and more. With custom tools you can extend it to call external APIs or trigger WordPress hooks. The separate SD AI Agent Advanced companion plugin adds trusted developer tools such as WP-CLI dispatchers, filesystem mutation, raw database diagnostics, and low-level WordPress function calls. Any plugin that registers abilities through the WordPress Abilities API automatically makes those tools available to the agent.

= Is it safe? Will the AI break my site? =

The agent has a built-in confirmation system. Potentially destructive tool calls pause and ask for your approval before executing. You can configure each tool as "auto" (always allow), "confirm" (ask first), or "disabled" in the Abilities tab. Tool profiles let you restrict the agent to read-only access.

= Can I use this on a multisite network? =

Yes, the plugin works on both single-site and multisite WordPress installations. Each site has its own settings, sessions, memories, and automations.

= Why does the plugin require WordPress 7.0? =

SD AI Agent uses the native WordPress AI Client SDK and Abilities API. These APIs are available in WordPress 7.0 and later, so the plugin no longer bundles compatibility shims for older WordPress versions.
