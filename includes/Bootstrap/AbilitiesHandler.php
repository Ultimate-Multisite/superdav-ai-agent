/**
 * DI handler that registers all WordPress Abilities.

 * Replaces the 35 inline `XxxAbilities::register()` calls in
 * `sd-ai-agent.php` with a single DI-managed handler. Each ability
 * class's `register_abilities()` method is called on the
 * `wp_abilities_api_init` hook — bypassing the now-removed `register()`
 * stub layer since the DI system handles hook attachment directly.
 *
 * Also owns the `init`-time hooks previously embedded in the three ability
 * classes that needed extra wiring beyond abilities registration:
 *  - CustomPostTypeAbilities::restore_persisted_post_types() at priority 5
 *  - CustomTaxonomyAbilities::restore_persisted_taxonomies() at priority 5
 *  - PluginSandbox::auto_deactivate_fatal_plugins() at priority 10
